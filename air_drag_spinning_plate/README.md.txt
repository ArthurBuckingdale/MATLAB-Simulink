The purpose of this project is to model(roughly) the force of air being exerted on a plate which can change its orientation relative to the direction of the wind passing by it. 
This is a necessary equation to model the force on the fins of our 'orbital drop' lander. The fins will control the yaw of the container as it falls. We therefore need a force model
(again a basic one) to estimate this. Once completed, this will use the fins to control the yaw on descent.
