# Physics
This repo contains a variety of projects in the domain of physics(Written in MATLAB). The directories which begin by 'understanding' are lessons where we go through and analyse a certain system. For example the harmonic oscillator from intro physics or polytropes form a bit more advanced astrophysics. The goals of these are to learn about them and play around with the models to improve understandings of how systems work. The secondary goal is to better understand how we can use computers to increase knowledge and model things.

The other types of projects are more for research purposes for example the gravitational n-body solver. This will be designed with user friendliness in mind so the user can easily manipulate the initial conditions and observe the outputs. 

Most of these projects contain some files from the MATLAB filesharing. The licenses that i'm using will be included in the directories of the projects they are associated with.

As well, some of the scripts are MATLAB live scripts and the graphs will pop up along the way while the program is running. They contain text as well and operate similar to a Jupyter notebook in python.
