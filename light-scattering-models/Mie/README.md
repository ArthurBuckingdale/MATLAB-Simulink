# Mie Scattering (Courtesy of Jan Sch√§fer (jan.schaefer@ilm.uni-ulm.de))
This type of scattering is extremely elaborate and compensates for the size and shape of the electron shells for each molecule. It would be silly to re-program this from scratch.
We must ofcourse give lots of credit to the author listed above. The license to use MATLAB file exchange code is included here. 

### Why?
Well, as mentioned in Rayleigh scattering, we cannot assume that our molecules will be much smaller than the wavelength of light. We must therefore assume that the shape of the
orbital for each atom scatters light differently. This is ofcourse an incredibly complicated process involving bessel functions and spherical harmonics. We won't let that 
frighten us as we're interested in physics, not mathematics here.
