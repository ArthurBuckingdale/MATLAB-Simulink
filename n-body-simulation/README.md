# N-Body Solver

Contained here is an N-body solver. In this particular application, it is used for planets orbiting a star. The project is based off an undergrad thesis to determine the bulk 
densities of exoplanets. More functionality will be added in the future for non orbital mechanics. All the pieces are here for non planet related N-body simulations if 
the correct pieces of code are selected.
