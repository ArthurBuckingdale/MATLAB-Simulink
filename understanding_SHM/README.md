# Simple Harmonic Motion

This code is designed for me to learn simulink and provide a model for simple harmonic motion which may be more intuitive than a set of equations. We go through the model and
adjust the various parameters to see the effect on motion. It hopefully provides an intuitive framework to understand simple harmonic motion.
